    <p>
      I’m currently living in Saarbrücken, pursuing my masters in Computer Science at Universität des Saarlandes.

      My main research interests are in Computer Security and Privacy. I am also interested in Computer Networks. Previously, I worked at Juniper Networks for 3 years. Before that, I finished my undergraduate education at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India. My other professional experiences include a summer internships at Samsung R&D Institute, Bangalore and at Wegilant Net Solutions, Mumbai.

      I am interested in learning languages. I have high proficiency in 3 languages (Assamese, English and Hindi) and have working knowledge of 2 more languages (Bengali and Telugu). Currently I am learning French and German. Apart from this, I am also very interested in trekking and traveling.
