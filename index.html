  <div class="col-md-7">
    <p>
      I currently live in Saarbrücken, finishing up my masters in Computer Science
      at the Universität des Saarlandes. I am also a student research assistant
      at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, Saarbrücken since
      September 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
      My main research interests are in Computer Security and Privacy. I am also
      interested in Computer Networks. Previously, I worked at Juniper Networks
      for 3 years as Software Developer III. Before that, I finished my
      undergraduate education in Computer Science and Technology at Indian
      Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India. My other professional
      experiences include summer internships at Samsung R&D Institute,
      Bangalore (2014) and at Wegilant Net Solutions, Mumbai(2013).
    </p>
    <p>
      My interests outside academia is in learning languages and (mostly
      military) history. I read a lot about historical events that shaped the
      world the way it is today. I have high proficiency in 3 languages - Assamese,
      English and Hindi. I also have working knowledge of 3 more Indian languages
      - Bengali, Bhojpuri and Telugu. Currently I am learning French and German.
      Apart from this, I frequently go on treks, play sports and travel a bit.
